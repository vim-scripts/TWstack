TWstack has several commands for changing tab pages and windows.
There are commands for changing to the previously active window of tab
page.  There are also commands for saving window and tab pages on
stacks and returning to those saved windows and tab pages, also 
commands for viewing and manipulating those stacks.

All of the saved window and tab page information is done using unique
identifiers assigned to each window and tab page when they are created.
Changing the order of the windows or tab pages will not affect the saved
information.
